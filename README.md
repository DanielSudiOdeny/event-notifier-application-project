# Event Notification Application Project

An Event notifier application that allows event planners to connect with their audience by allowing audience to book ticket for the specific event the event planners create online.
It takes away the struggle for the audience having to physically purchase the tickets from the event planner and also makes it easy for event planners to find audience for their events.
Project Setup Instructions.

## How it works

### Users perspective

A user can simply login with the correct details and after a succesfull login, the user will be able to access the welcome page.
The user can then click on browse events which will take the user directly to some of the events that are available at the moment.

A user also has the option to:

* Search for events by either typing the actual name of event and precise location.
* Search for events by specifying the location under the filter search.
* Search for events by specifying the event type under the filter search.
* Search for events by specifying the music genre under the filter search.

* The user can then go ahead select get tickets where they will be redirected to a page that asks them to key in they details inorder to book a ticket.
* After a successfull booking the booking details will be updated to the server.
This project setup instructions will also be included inside each folder of the different challenges

### Event planners perspective

An Event planner can also login with their correct details and after a successfull, login the user will be able to access the welcome page.

* This time the Event planner can view previous events or decide to create a new event by simply pressing on the create events button and filling in all the neccessary details required.

* After filling in the details, the new event will appear as a snippet and the event planner will be prompted to confirm whether the event should be added to the featured events.
* If the event planner types in Y (Yes) then the new event is then added to the featured events and users can book a ticket.  Viceversa is not true.

## Project setup instructions

* Download any text editor for your coding environment. I recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the live-server extension.
* Fork this repository to your github repository.
* Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to your local machine.
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Setup a a mock server. I recommend json-server.
* Right click on the index.html and you will now be able to access and use the application.
